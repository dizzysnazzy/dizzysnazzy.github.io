                <p class="card-text">This is a career website which I developed using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL
                    Workbench. This web application enables users to search for job
                    openings, apply for positions, and manage their applications. I
                    Implemented a MySQL database with SQLAlchemy, utilizing its
                    ORM capabilities for efficient data management. Also designed the
                    database schema and handled data operations using MySQL
                    Workbench. I leveraged Replit, an online development environment,
                    for seamless coding and testing. The career website project offers a
                    user-friendly interface for job seekers to explore and apply for
                    opportunities while providing a robust backend for managing job
                    postings and applicant information.
